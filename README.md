# Javascript-Quiz

The goal of this project is to showcase my abilities by making a JavaScript Quiz

As a user you should be able to click on begin and start the quiz
you should be able to go from question to question until the quiz is complete

When quiz is complete you should be able to save your score and compare with your peers.

As a developer I need to create the functionality so that the user may accomplish what is expected.
